    * In order to get a better grasp on function expressions, I referred to this Youtube video.  I was having a little difficulty figuring out how to call the function expression, but after watching this I understood how the fuction expression worked instead of randomly trying things until I found something that worked for me.

    * This Lynda.com training that was recommended within the Canvas modules really boosted my confidence while working with Javascript.  I was definitely intimidated initially, but after working through this training I felt much more comfortable.

# Comments
Really struggled with **item 6 c.**, but appreciated working through it so I can tackle functions a little easier in the future.  Some instructions were a little vague in terms of what should be on each branch, but other than that I really enjoyed the assignment! _Thank you!_
